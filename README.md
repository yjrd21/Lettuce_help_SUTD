# Lettuce-Help
An app that addresses inefficiencies in the donation and collection process of FoodBank SG boxes.

## Problem statement
When it comes to the donation process, Donors occasionally encounter overfilled boxes due to the manual nature of inspecting these boxes - i.e, when a FoodBank box is reaching full capacity, an individual must physically inspect the box to notify Foodbank that the box is ready for collection. If this process is not carried out, food donations will accumulate in the box and donors, who wish to donate to that same box, will either leave the donated food crowding around the box (pest hazard) or find another Foodbank box to donate to (time and energy wasted). Both of these scenarios are not ideal.

### Key feature
Lettuce-help addresses these issues by delivering box capacity data at the fingertips of the user. 

Box capacity data is obtained via a smart food box that is equipped with an ultrasonic sensor -to detect box capacity- and a wifi-module- to allow for real time updates. 

For staff accounts, box capacity data is displayed in a recycler view format, sorted from most filled to least filled. 

For volunteer accounts, box capacity data is incorporated into google maps, where the location of all FoodBank boxes- relative to a volunteer's current position- is displayed with its corresponding capacities. 

These solutions allow staff to prioritize the collection of filled boxes and volunteers to avoid filled boxes.

### Additional features

The app contains user registration, forget password, reset password and issue reporting functionalities.
